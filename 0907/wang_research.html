<h1>Miao Wang's Reseach Program </h1>

<h2 style="color:orange;">Introduction</h2>
<p>My name is Miao Wang. I am a graduate student of at department of biological science. My research program is focus on 3D genome structure. Genome sequence is very long and packages into a small nuclear. The 3D structure of genome is not random and has a big influence on gene transcription. I am studing how chromosome artitecture influences gene exprssioon and determines cell differencitiation fate. To look more about our lab research,click  <a href="https://www.bio.fsu.edu/~fraserlab/">here</a>. </p>

<h2 style="color:orange;">What is promoter capture hic?</h2>
<p>Promoter Capture HiC a method that is able to look the contacts of two DNA fragments, includes promters and promoters contacts and cis regulatory elements and promoters contacts.This data also can be used to link human disease-associated variants to their target gene,which has a very important role in disease diagnosis and therapies. </p>

This is image of 3D structure of chromosome. Each color represent one chromosome. We can see that different chromsome roll up together. There genome sequenceing data is huge so that it needs computational method to analyse the data. It is very intersting to use computational methods for solving biological questions.
